# Sprint Lesson: SASS Typography & Semantic HTML

## 1. LxD Cycle Process

**Empathize:** I noticed a lot of students try to manually style text using custom classes (like `<p class="big-bold">Main Heading</p>`) instead of letting the global SASS theme handle it through proper HTML structure. This breaks our site's visual consistency and messes up accessibility.

**Define:** 
* **POV:** CSP students need a way to build web pages using semantic HTML because relying on manual CSS classes creates messy code and inaccessible design.
* **Learning Goal:** Students will understand how to use global SASS typography styling by applying the correct semantic HTML tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<strong>`, etc.) instead of custom classes.

**Ideate:** 
* **HMW Question:** How might we teach students to trust global SASS styles and stop hardcoding text appearance? 
* **Activity:** Refactoring a poorly written HTML snippet into clean, semantic HTML that automatically inherits our SASS theme.

**Prototype & Test:** I taught a trial run to my project team. They felt the original homework was too long, so I revised it to be a single, focused refactoring task (documented below).

## 2. Lesson Plan

**Learning Objective:** By the end of this lesson, you will be able to structure text using semantic HTML tags so it automatically inherits our global SASS typography styles without using custom classes. 

**Success Criteria:** You can take an unformatted block of text, apply the correct headings, paragraphs, and list tags, and have it match our site's design system perfectly.

### Tech Talk (3 minutes)
We are using a global SASS typography system. This means **you don't need to write CSS for your text**. Instead of styling text to look a certain way, you just need to tell the browser *what* the text is. There’s already a global system to take care of the styling.

* **The Rule:** Use semantic HTML tags. Let the system handle the look.
* ✅ **Do this:** `<h1>Main Heading</h1>` or `<strong>Important</strong>`
* ❌ **Don't do this:** `<div class="title-text">Main Heading</div>` or `<p class="bold">Important</p>`

Why do we do this? It ensures our whole project looks consistent, makes our code cleaner, and is essential for screen readers and SEO.

### Supported Tags Reference Guide

Before we jump into the examples, here is a quick cheat sheet of the tags we use to build our visual hierarchy. 

| Tag | Purpose | Usage Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `<h1>` | Page title | Used once per page (top-level heading) |
| `<h2>` | Section titles | Major sections within a page |
| `<h3>` | Sub-sections or card headers | Grouping inside `<h2>` sections |
| `<h4>` | Minor headings | Optional for smaller sub-sections |
| `<p>` | Paragraphs and body content | Default for most content text |
| `<strong>` | Emphasis or importance | Highlights key words/phrases |
| `<em>` | Subtle emphasis or tone shift | Used for soft emphasis (like italics) |
| `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>` | Lists | Use for bullets or ordered items |

### Code Examples

**1. Simple: Basic Headings and Paragraphs**
```html
<!-- We use h1 for the single page title, h2 for major sections, and p for body text. -->
<h1>About Our Project</h1>
<h2>The Team</h2>
<p>We are a group of CSP students building a cool web app.</p>

**2. Intermediate: Adding Emphasis**
```html
<!-- Don't use bold or italics classes. Use semantic meaning. -->
<p>You <strong>must</strong> commit your code daily.</p>
<p>It is <em>highly recommended</em> to leave comments.</p>
```

**3. Complex: Full Section Structure**
```html
<!-- Grouping content properly using hierarchy -->
<h2>Setup Instructions</h2>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Python 3.9+</li>
  <li>VS Code</li>
</ul>
<h3>Installation Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Clone the repo.</li>
  <li>Run the setup script.</li>
</ol>
```

## 3. Hacks & Practice Tasks

### Popcorn Hack (In-Class)
**Task:** Look at the bad code below. Drop the corrected, semantic version of this code in the chat within 2 minutes. 
```html
<div class="huge-text">Welcome!</div>
<span class="sub-title">Read this</span>
<div class="normal">This is a sentence.</div>
```

### Homework Hack
**Task:** Refactor the following code block. Remove all the inline styles and custom classes, and replace them with the correct semantic HTML tags (`h1`-`h4`, `p`, `ul`/`ol`/`li`, `strong`, `em`) so it uses our Aesthetihawk SASS theme. Submit the clean HTML code to our issue tracker.

```html
<p class="title-font">Project Features</p>
<p class="section-font">User Accounts</p>
<p class="body-text">Users can make an account and log in. This is a <span class="very-important">crucial</span> feature.</p>
<p class="body-text">Steps to register:</p>
<p class="list-item">1. Click register</p>
<p class="list-item">2. Enter email</p>
<p class="list-item">3. Set password</p>
```

## 4. Grading Plan (1 Point Total)
* **0.2 points:** Participated in the Popcorn Hack with a reasonable attempt.
* **0.8 points:** Homework Hack is submitted and correctly uses semantic tags instead of classes (0.4 for correct heading hierarchy, 0.4 for converting the fake list into a real `<ol>`).

---

## 5. Lesson Revisions & Feedback Evidence
* **Feedback Received:** During my peer practice run, my teammate pointed out that my original Popcorn Hack asked them to write a whole HTML page from scratch, which took longer than 5 minutes and killed the lesson's momentum.
* **Revision Made:** I changed the Popcorn Hack to a simple 3-line refactor that they can do directly in the chat window. This keeps engagement high and takes under 2 minutes.
